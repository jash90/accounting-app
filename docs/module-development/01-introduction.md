This comprehensive guide walks you through creating a new business module in the Accounting API system. We'll build a **Tasks Module** as a complete example, demonstrating all patterns, integrations, and best practices.

## What You'll Learn

- Creating entities with multi-tenant support
- Implementing CRUD operations with proper authorization
- Integrating with the RBAC system
- Database migrations
- Module registration and configuration
- Testing your module

## Example Module: Tasks

We'll build a task management module that allows:
- Companies to manage their tasks

- Complete multi-tenant data isolation

## Estimated Time

**2-4 hours** for first-time implementation
**1-2 hours** for experienced developers
